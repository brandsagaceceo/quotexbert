## Roof Repair vs Replacement: The GTA Homeowner's Guide

Your Toronto/GTA roof is leaking, missing shingles, or showing its age. The big question: **repair or replace?**

## Quick Decision Matrix

**Repair if:**
- ✅ Roof is under 15 years old
- ✅ Damage is localized (under 30% of roof)
- ✅ Only 1-2 layers of shingles exist
- ✅ No water damage inside
- ✅ Budget is tight (under $2,000)

**Replace if:**
- ❌ Roof is 20+ years old
- ❌ Multiple leaks or widespread damage
- ❌ 2-3 layers already (Ontario code max)
- ❌ Sagging, rot, or interior damage
- ❌ Selling home soon (ROI is 85-95%)

## Cost Comparison (GTA 2026)

### Roof Repair Costs
- **Minor (5-10 shingles)**: $300 - $600
- **Moderate (flashing, valleys)**: $600 - $1,500
- **Major (one section)**: $1,500 - $3,500

### Roof Replacement Costs
- **Asphalt (1,500 sq ft)**: $5,500 - $8,500
- **Architectural shingles**: $7,500 - $11,000
- **Metal roofing**: $12,000 - $18,000
- **Flat roof (EPDM)**: $8,000 - $12,000

**Per square foot**: $3.50 - $7.50 (asphalt), $8 - $12 (metal)

## When Repairs Make Sense

### 1. Storm Damage (Localized)
Recent hail or wind damage to a small area of a newer roof? Repair is smarter.

**Cost**: $800 - $2,000
**Timeline**: 1 day
**Lifespan**: 5-10 years (if roof is otherwise healthy)

### 2. Flashing Issues
Around chimneys, skylights, or vents? Often a flashing problem, not full roof failure.

**Cost**: $400 - $1,200
**Timeline**: 4-8 hours
**Common in**: Older Toronto homes with multiple roof penetrations

### 3. Minor Leaks
Single leak without interior damage? Patch first, monitor second.

**Cost**: $300 - $800
**When it fails**: If leak returns or spreads, replacement time

## When Replacement is Necessary

### 1. Age (20+ Years in GTA Climate)
Toronto's freeze-thaw cycles are brutal. Most asphalt shingles last:
- **Standard**: 15-20 years
- **Architectural**: 20-25 years
- **Premium**: 25-30 years

After 20 years, repairs become Band-Aids.

### 2. Multiple Layers
Ontario building code allows max 2 layers. If you have 2 already, next job MUST be full tear-off and replacement.

**Why**: Weight load, code compliance, proper inspection

### 3. Interior Damage
Water stains, mold, or sagging ceiling? The roof membrane is compromised. Repair won't fix underlying issues.

**Risk**: Mold, structural damage, insurance denial

### 4. Widespread Granule Loss
Shingles losing granules (look in gutters)? UV protection is gone. Roof will fail within 2-5 years.

## Cost-Benefit Analysis

### Example: 25-Year-Old Roof, $2,000 Repair vs $8,000 Replacement

**Repair Option:**
- Cost: $2,000 now
- Lifespan: 2-4 years
- Future cost: $8,500 replacement (2028 prices)
- **Total (5 years)**: $10,500

**Replace Option:**
- Cost: $8,000 now
- Lifespan: 20-25 years
- No major costs for 20 years
- **Total (5 years)**: $8,000

**Replacement saves $2,500** over 5 years (and you get a new roof for 20 years)

## GTA-Specific Considerations

### Ice Dams (Toronto Winters)
Ice damming is common in Toronto. If your roof leaks every winter, it's likely:
- Inadequate attic insulation
- Poor ventilation
- Aging shingles

**Fix**: Replacement with ice & water shield + ventilation upgrades

### Home Insurance
Many GTA insurers won't cover roofs over 20 years old. Check your policy!

**Replacement benefits**:
- Lower premiums
- Full coverage
- Inspection pass

### Resale Value (Hot GTA Market)
New roof adds $10,000-15,000 to sale price and helps homes sell 20% faster.

**When selling**: Replace if roof is 18+ years old

## Finding GTA Roofers

**Verify**:
- WSIB coverage (mandatory in Ontario)
- $2M+ liability insurance
- Written warranty (10-25 years)
- References in your area

**Red flags**:
- Door-to-door roofers after storms
- Requires full payment upfront
- Unusually low quotes (30%+ below average)
- No written contract

**Get 3-5 quotes**. Pricing varies significantly across the GTA:
- Toronto: $8-12/sq ft
- Durham: $6-9/sq ft
- York Region: $7-10/sq ft

## Permits & Inspections

**Repair**: Usually no permit needed

**Replacement**: Building permit required ($200-400) in Toronto, Oshawa, Clarington, Markham, etc.

**Inspection**: City inspector will verify:
- Proper ventilation
- Ice & water shield
- Flashing installation

## Best Time to Replace (GTA)

**Ideal**: May-October (dry, warm weather)

**Budget savings**: September-November (off-peak = 10-15% lower quotes)

**Emergency**: Winter replacements cost 20-30% more

## Conclusion

**Repair if** your GTA roof is under 15 years old, damage is localized, and you're not selling soon. **Replace if** it's 20+ years old, has multiple issues, or you need insurance/resale value.

**Average costs**: Repair $300-3,500, Replace $5,500-18,000 depending on material and size.
