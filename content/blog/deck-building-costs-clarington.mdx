## Clarington-Specific Considerations

### 1. Frost Depth
In Durham Region, frost line is **4 feet (1.2m)** deep. Your footings MUST go below this to prevent heaving. Budget for deeper holes and more concrete than in warmer climates.

### 2. Winter Preparation
Clarington winters are brutal on decks. Plan for:
- Proper drainage slope (1/4" per foot minimum)
- Quality fasteners that won't rust
- Annual staining/sealing (PT and Cedar)

### 3. HOA/Condo Rules
Some Clarington neighborhoods (especially newer developments in Courtice and Bowmanville) have strict HOA rules about deck design, color, and materials. Check BEFORE you build!

### 4. Best Time to Build
**April-October** is deck building season in Clarington. Book early (February/March) for best rates and availability. Off-season builds are rare due to concrete curing requirements.
