- **Complex installation** (new holes, valve replacement): 2-3 hours = $250 - $450

**Regional Differences:**

- **GTA suburbs** (Mississauga, Brampton, Markham): $100 - $130/hour

> **Pro Tip**: Many Toronto plumbers charge a flat rate for standard faucet replacement ($180 - $250) rather than hourly, which can save you money on straightforward jobs.

## Factors That Affect Cost

### 1. Faucet Type & Complexity

**Single-Hole Faucets**: Simplest to install (1-1.5 hours)

**3-Hole/4-Hole Faucets**: More complex, especially if switching from 1-hole (2-3 hours)

**Wall-Mount Faucets**: Requires in-wall plumbing access, most expensive (3-5 hours + potential drywall work)

### 2. Additional Work Required

- **New supply lines**: +$30-50
- **Deck plate or escutcheon**: +$20-40
- **Shut-off valve replacement**: +$80-150 per valve
- **Sink removal** (if needed): +$100-200

### 3. Location & Accessibility

Older Toronto homes (pre-1970s) often have:
- Corroded shut-off valves that break when turned
- Non-standard pipe sizes
- Limited under-sink access

These can add $50-200 to the job.

## DIY vs Hiring a Plumber

### When to DIY

You can save $150-300 by installing yourself if:
- ✅ You have basic tool skills
- ✅ Shut-off valves are in good condition
- ✅ It's a direct replacement (same hole configuration)
- ✅ You have 2-3 hours and patience

**Tools needed**: Adjustable wrench, basin wrench, plumber's tape, flashlight

### When to Hire a Pro

Hire a licensed Toronto/GTA plumber if:
- ❌ Shut-off valves are old/corroded
- ❌ You're changing hole configurations
- ❌ There are leaks or water damage
- ❌ You're uncomfortable working under the sink
- ❌ You lack the necessary tools

> **Important**: In Ontario, major plumbing work requires a licensed plumber to maintain home insurance coverage. While faucet replacement is generally considered minor, valve replacement should be done by a pro.

## Best Faucet Brands for Toronto Climate

Toronto's hard water and temperature extremes (hello, -20°C winters!) mean durability matters.

**Top Performers in GTA Homes:**

1. **Moen** - Excellent warranty, widely available parts, good for hard water
2. **Delta** - Touch2O technology, lifetime warranty, solid mid-range choice
3. **Kohler** - Premium quality, stylish designs, handles hard water well
4. **Grohe** - German engineering, pricey but lasts 20+ years

**Avoid**: Ultra-cheap no-name brands from discount stores. They often fail within 2-3 years and cost more to replace repeatedly.

## Where to Buy in Toronto/GTA

**Big Box Stores**:
- Home Depot (Multiple GTA locations)
- Lowe's (Pickering, Whitby, Oshawa)
- Canadian Tire (Widespread)
- Prices: Usually best for budget/mid-range

**Plumbing Supply Stores**:
- Wolseley (Toronto, Oshawa)
- Emco (Multiple GTA)
- Better selection, trade pricing with plumber

**Online**:
- Amazon.ca (Free shipping, easy returns)
- Wayfair.ca (Wide selection, frequent sales)
- Check return policies carefully!

## Step-by-Step Cost Example

**Scenario**: Replacing a basic 1-hole faucet in an Ajax home

1. **Moen Arbor pull-down faucet**: $189 (Home Depot)
2. **New supply lines**: $25
3. **Plumber** (Ajax-based, 1.5 hours @ $110/hr): $165
4. **HST** (13% on labor): $21.45

**Total Cost: $400.45 CAD**

## Hidden Costs to Watch For

1. **Corroded shut-off valves**: If they break when turned off, expect +$150-300 to replace
2. **Deck plate needed**: If switching from 3-hole to 1-hole, you need a deck plate (+$30-60)
3. **Weekend/evening rates**: Many GTA plumbers charge 1.5x on weekends/evenings
4. **Emergency calls**: After-hours service can be 2-3x regular rates

## How to Save Money

1. **Buy your own faucet**: Many plumbers mark up fixtures 20-40%. Buy it yourself and just pay for installation.

2. **Check for sales**: Home Depot and Lowe's run frequent faucet promotions (especially long weekends).

3. **Get 3 quotes**: Plumber rates vary significantly across the GTA. Use QuoteXbert to connect with multiple licensed professionals.

4. **Bundle work**: If you need other plumbing done, bundle it to avoid multiple service call fees.

5. **Off-season scheduling**: Plumbers are busiest in spring/summer. Book in winter for better rates.

## Finding a Plumber in Toronto/GTA

**What to verify**:
- ✅ Licensed and insured
- ✅ WSIB coverage (protects you from liability)
- ✅ Written quote with breakdown
- ✅ Warranty on workmanship (at least 1 year)
- ✅ References or reviews

**Red flags**:
- ❌ Cash-only, no receipt
- ❌ Pressure to buy specific brands
- ❌ No insurance/WSIB
- ❌ Vague "ballpark" estimates

## Permits & Code Requirements

Good news: **No permit required** for kitchen faucet replacement in Toronto or anywhere in the GTA. This is considered routine maintenance/repair.

However, if you're doing a full kitchen renovation with new plumbing lines, you'll need permits from your municipality.

## Timeline

**DIY**: 1.5-3 hours (first time), 45 minutes (experienced)

**Professional**: 1-2 hours including cleanup

**Best time to schedule**: Weekday mornings for best rates and availability

## Conclusion

Replacing a kitchen faucet in Toronto and the GTA costs **$250-800 CAD** depending on the faucet and labor involved. For a standard mid-range replacement, budget around $400-500 total.
