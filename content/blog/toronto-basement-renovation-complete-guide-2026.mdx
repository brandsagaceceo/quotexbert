- ✅ Neutral colors (grays, whites, beiges)
- ✅ Quality lighting (pot lights every 6-8 feet)
- ✅ Durable flooring (engineered hardwood, tile, luxury vinyl)
- ✅ Ample storage (closets, built-ins)
- ✅ Modern finishes (contemporary, clean lines)
- ✅ Energy-efficient (LED lights, good insulation)

**Don't:**
- ❌ Bold colors (hard for buyers to envision)
- ❌ Cheap finishes (carpet, laminate, builder-grade)
- ❌ Poor lighting (dark, few fixtures)
- ❌ Quirky layouts (oddly-shaped rooms)
- ❌ Overly personalized (themed rooms)
- ❌ Skip permits (kills resale)

## Tax Implications & Rental Income

### Rental Income (Legal Suite)

**Income potential (Toronto 2026):**
- 1-bedroom suite: $1,800-$2,300/month
- 2-bedroom suite: $2,200-$2,800/month

**Annual income**: $21,600-$33,600

**Less expenses:**
- Utilities (if included): $150-$300/month
- Property tax increase: $500-$1,500/year
- Insurance increase: $200-$600/year
- Maintenance: $1,000-$2,000/year

**Net income**: $16,000-$28,000/year

**Mortgage offset**: Covers $300,000-$500,000 mortgage payment

### Tax Deductions

**You can deduct (from rental income):**
- % of mortgage interest (proportional to suite size)
- % of property taxes
- % of utilities
- % of home insurance
- % of maintenance/repairs
- Advertising for tenants
- Legal fees
- Accounting fees

**Example**: If basement suite is 40% of home's total space, you can deduct 40% of eligible expenses.

**Capital Cost Allowance (CCA)**: Can depreciate renovation costs over time, but triggers capital gains on sale.

**Pro tip**: Consult accountant before claiming CCA (can be disadvantageous on sale).

### Principal Residence Exemption

**Good news**: You can rent part of your home and STILL claim principal residence exemption on sale (avoid capital gains).

**Requirements:**
- You live in the home
- Rental portion is "incidental" (typically under 50% of space)
- No structural separation (e.g., no separate address may be safer)

**Consult**: Tax professional before renting to optimize tax strategy.

## Insurance Considerations

### Standard Home Insurance (No Rental)

**Covers**: Finished basement as part of home

**Cost impact**: Minimal increase ($50-$200/year) - higher home value = slightly higher premium

### Rental Suite Insurance

**Required if you rent out basement:**
- Landlord policy or endorsement
- Covers: Liability, tenant damage, loss of rental income
- **Cost**: +$200-$600/year

**Important**: TELL your insurance company you're renting. Failure to disclose = denied claims.

### What's Covered

**Standard coverage:**
- Sudden water damage (pipe burst)
- Fire
- Vandalism
- Liability

**Usually NOT covered:**
- Seepage/groundwater
- Sewer backup (add endorsement: +$50-$150/year)
- Flood (rare in basements)
- Tenant theft

**Recommended additions:**
- Sewer backup: +$50-$150/year (essential for basements)
- Increased liability: +$100-$200/year

## Financing Your Toronto Basement Renovation

### Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC)

**Best for**: Legal suites, larger renovations ($50K+)

**Pros:**
- Low interest (Prime + 0.5-1%) = ~7-8%
- Only pay interest on what you use
- Flexible borrowing/repayment
- Reusable credit line

**Cons:**
- Requires 20% home equity
- Variable rate
- Minimum payment = interest only (can drag on)

**Toronto average**: $100,000-$250,000 available credit

**How to get**: Bank, credit union (2-6 weeks approval)

### Cash-Out Refinance

**Best for**: Major renovations ($75K+), low existing rate

**Pros:**
- Lowest interest rate
- Fixed payment
- Can borrow up to 80% of home value
- Long repayment (25-30 years)

**Cons:**
- Closing costs ($2,000-$5,000)
- Extends mortgage term
- Penalties on existing mortgage (if breaking early)

**Example**: Home worth $900K, owe $400K → Refinance to $720K (80%) = $320K available for renovation

### Personal Line of Credit / Loan

**Best for**: Smaller projects ($20K-$50K)

**Pros:**
- Fast approval
- No home equity needed
- Fixed payment (loan) or flexible (LOC)

**Cons:**
- Higher interest (8-15%)
- Lower borrowing limit ($50K max typically)
