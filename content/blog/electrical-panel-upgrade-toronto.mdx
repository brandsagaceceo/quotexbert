## Electrical Panel Upgrade Costs in Toronto & GTA

Upgrading your electrical panel is essential when adding EV chargers, home additions, or if your home still has a 60A or 100A panel. Here's what it costs in 2026.

## Average Costs

### 100A to 200A Upgrade
- **Toronto**: $2,500 - $3,800
- **GTA suburbs**: $2,200 - $3,400
- **Durham Region**: $2,000 - $3,200

### 60A to 200A Upgrade (with service upgrade)
- **Toronto**: $3,500 - $5,500
- **GTA suburbs**: $3,200 - $5,000
- **Durham Region**: $3,000 - $4,800

### New Subpanel Installation
- **Cost**: $800 - $1,800
- **Use case**: Garage, basement suite, addition

## What's Included

✅ New electrical panel (200A)
✅ All breakers
✅ Labor (6-10 hours)
✅ ESA permit & inspection
✅ Connection to utility (Toronto Hydro/Whitby Hydro)
✅ Grounding upgrades (if needed)

❌ **Not included**: Utility service cable replacement (Toronto Hydro charges separately), aluminum wiring remediation, knob & tube removal

## When You Need an Upgrade

### Signs Your Panel is Undersized
- Frequent breaker trips
- Flickering lights under load
- Can't add circuits (panel full)
- Planning EV charger installation
- Adding central A/C
- Major renovation/addition

### 100A vs 200A

**100A panel** handles:
- Standard home appliances
- Central A/C
- Electric dryer
- Modern lighting

**200A panel** handles all above PLUS:
- Level 2 EV charger (40-50A)
- Electric vehicle (future-proofing)
- Hot tub
- Workshop with power tools
- Secondary suite

**Recommendation**: Always upgrade to 200A. Cost difference is only $200-400 but future-proofs your home.

## ESA Permit & Inspection Process

All electrical panel work in Ontario requires:

1. **Licensed electrician** (309A or 442A license)
2. **ESA permit** ($160-250, included in quote)
3. **ESA inspection** (within 48 hours of completion)

**Timeline**: 
- Permit approval: Same day (online)
- Installation: 1 day
- ESA inspection: 2-3 business days
- **Total**: 5-7 days

### What ESA Inspects
✅ Proper panel installation
✅ Correct breaker sizing
✅ Grounding & bonding
✅ Arc-fault breakers (required in bedrooms)
✅ Tamper-resistant outlets (if affected)

**Failure rate**: ~15% of panels fail first inspection (usually minor issues)

**Re-inspection fee**: $70 if failed

## Cost by Region (GTA)

| Area | 100A→200A | 60A→200A |
|------|-----------|----------|
| Downtown Toronto | $3,200-3,800 | $4,800-5,500 |
| North York | $2,800-3,400 | $4,200-5,000 |
| Scarborough | $2,600-3,200 | $4,000-4,800 |
| Mississauga | $2,600-3,300 | $4,000-4,900 |
| Markham | $2,700-3,400 | $4,100-5,000 |
| Oshawa/Durham | $2,400-3,000 | $3,600-4,500 |

**Why the variation**: Travel time, competition, permit costs

## Aluminum Wiring Consideration

Many 1960s-70s GTA homes have aluminum wiring. If your home does:

**Options**:
1. **Pigtailing** (copper connectors): +$800-1,500
2. **Full rewire** (recommended): $8,000-15,000

**ESA requires** proper aluminum connections during panel upgrades.

## Utility Service Upgrade

If your home has overhead service from Toronto Hydro, they may require:

- **New service drop**: $500-1,200 (Toronto Hydro fee)
- **Upgraded meter base**: Included in electrician quote
- **Service entrance cable**: +$400-800

**Timeline**: Toronto Hydro requires 2-4 weeks notice for service upgrades.

## Choosing an Electrician

**Must verify**:
- ✅ 309A license (Master Electrician) or 442A (Licensed)
- ✅ ESA registered contractor
- ✅ WSIB coverage
- ✅ $2M liability insurance
- ✅ References with ESA-inspected work

**Red flags**:
- ❌ Offers to skip ESA permit
- ❌ Significantly cheaper than competitors (30%+)
- ❌ Can't provide license number
- ❌ Won't give written quote

**Get 3-4 quotes**. Electricians should provide:
- License number
- Detailed breakdown
- Permit fees included
- Timeline
- Warranty (1 year minimum)

## Cost-Saving Tips

1. **Bundle work**: If rewiring rooms, do it during panel upgrade
2. **Shop around**: Quotes vary $500-1,000 for same work
3. **Seasonal timing**: November-February often 10% cheaper
4. **Avoid urgency**: Emergency rates are 2x normal
5. **Ask about aluminum wiring**: Some electricians include pigtailing, others charge extra

## Timeline & Process

**Day 1 (Morning)**: 
- Toronto Hydro disconnects power (1-2 hours)
- Electrician removes old panel

**Day 1 (Afternoon)**:
- Install new 200A panel
- Connect all circuits
- Electrician tests everything
- Toronto Hydro reconnects power

**Day 2-3**:
- ESA inspector visits
- Issues certificate (if passed)

**Total downtime**: 4-8 hours (plan to be out of house or use generator)

## ROI & Home Value

**Toronto/GTA market**:
- 200A panel expected in homes $800K+
- Upgrading adds $2,000-4,000 to resale value
- Makes home more attractive to buyers
- Required for home insurance on older homes

**ROI**: 40-60% of cost recovered, but often necessary for:
- Home insurance renewal
- Passing home inspection (when selling)
- EV ownership
- Modern lifestyle needs
