Title: "Built an AI tool to check if contractor quotes are fair — thought it might help"

Post:
```
Moved to Toronto 2 years ago. Got completely ripped off on my first reno (paid $12K for a job that should've been $6K).

Built QuoteXbert to solve this. You upload photos of your project, it gives you a detailed estimate based on 1,000+ real Toronto contractor quotes.

It's free. No signup. Just wanted to share in case anyone's in the same boat.

If you're about to hire someone, might be worth checking first: [URL]

Not trying to promote — genuinely just wish I had this when I got burned.

**Facebook Groups (Local Toronto Home Improvement Groups)**

Post:
```
PSA: Before you accept a contractor's quote, check if it's fair.

I've been using QuoteXbert (free AI tool) to compare quotes. Found out I was about to overpay by $4,000 on my bathroom reno.

Takes 30 seconds. Upload photos, get instant pricing based on real Toronto jobs.

Hope this helps someone avoid what I almost did 😅
